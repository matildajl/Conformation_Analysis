# MasterThesis - Conformation Analysis
In this project, the conformations of different sugars were investigated by changing the dihedral angle and using distances to calculate the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). To simplify the process, a program was created to test an interval for the dihedral angles and automatically measure the defined distances.

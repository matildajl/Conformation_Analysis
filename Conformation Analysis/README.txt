This folder contains the program Conformation Analysis. To use the program
follow the instructions in the tutorial ConformationAnalysisTutorial.pdf. 
If changes are made in the scripts or files are removed the program may fail
to work as it should. 

What the folder contains:

'calc_dist.py'
A script called from MAIN.py to calculate distances between defined atoms.

'calcRMSD.py'
A script called from MAIN.py to calculate RMSD.

'ConformationAnalysisTutorial.pdf'
A tutorial for the program Conformation Analysis.

'getDihAngle.py'
